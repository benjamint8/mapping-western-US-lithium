# Mapping Western U.S. Lithium Extraction Efforts
Welcome! This repository holds research-related materials on lithium extraction efforts in the Western United States generated by Group Four* of Section J of Professor James Deavenport's Synthesis 100 course on mapping climate changes with GIS at the University of California, San Diego.

Our project examined lithium extraction projects in the following locations:
- Salton Sea, CA
- Silver Peak, NV
- Thacker Pass, NV
- Jackpot Lake, NV
- Great Salt Lake, UT

Our project specifically focused on understanding the current issues with lithium extraction (including water scarcity and Indigenous rights) as well as mitigative measures that can reduce the damage caused by (or the need for) lithium extraction. This repository holds relevant research and maps which elucidate both the issues and the potential solutions at hand.

For project records including the project proposal, the project final presentation, research materials, and more, please refer to the "Documents" folder of the repository.

For GIS maps of the aforementioned locations, please refer to the "Maps" folder of the repository. Please also note that information mapped from location to location may vary.

*Members of Group Four include: Benjamin Tarver, Shining Zhang, Alex Sieh, Gensheng Lin, and Ashley Garcia.
